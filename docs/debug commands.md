Debug commands in Archipelago SC2 are in-game chat commands, intended to be used by developers for testing and bug fixing purposes. They are similar to cheat codes, but usually provide benefits more specific to AP or the current mission. Since they are intended to be used by developers for testing, they often have shorthand variants, to prevent activating these commands by accident it is required to enable Debug Mode first with a separate command. Entering Debug Mode enables all other debug commands. Every Debug command starts with a dash/minus '-'

Debug commmands can be divided into 3 categories:

• Generic: These commands work in ANY Archipelago SC2 mission.
• Semi Generic: These commands are not implemented in every single mission, but they are shared across many missions where they make sense. Example: Skip to the next section of a mission.
• Map Specific: These commands test a specific feature of the mission you are currently playing. Example: Complete a bonus objective.

Full list of Debug Commmands:


Generic: These commands can be used in any Archipelago SC2 mission

-debug, -d: Activate Debug Mode, required to use all the other debug commands


-control x: Take one-sided control of player x
-reapply: Reapplies default behaviors to all your units. Fixes certain bugs where units do not get all benefits from their items
-resetbase, -reset: Resets many aspects of your main base, including Spear of Adun energy/cooldown and Merc cooldown
-skip, -s: Skips all transmissions currently playing, and allows other triggers queued after these transmissions to progress the mission state
-clear, -c: Clears the action queue, retaining the one action currently running. WARNING: This can soft-lock your game!
-tech x: Grant tech level x (0-4). Unlocks AP items for the mission only. Level 0 unlocks a basic unit, Level 1-4 unlock units and upgrades to handle mission of the respective difficulty (easy, medium, hard, very hard)
-checks: Grants all checks you can get for the current mission, except Victory (use -win to get Victory checks)

-win: Ends the mission in victory, granting the victory location (intended to work in all missions, does not work for all missions at this time)
-revive, -r: Revives your heroes instantly (currently only works with Kerrigan, intended to work with other heroes like Nova)


Semi-generic: These commands are not implemented in every single mission, but they are shared across multiple missions where they make sense

-sx: Skip to Section X. This command is implemented in most missions that have multiple sections. For example, typing '-s2' in the mission "The Dig" will skip Section 1, the Siege Tank introduction and proceed to Section 2, the defense of the Laser Drill.

This is intended to be a prototype for the future implementation of a Checkpoint system.
