# SC2 Archipelago Map and Mod data
This repo contains the required StarCraft2 map and mod data for Archipelago

## Dev setup
For the client to start a map, the map and mod dependencies must be in the Starcraft 2 install directory,
under the Maps/ and Mods/ folders respectively.

### Building a local download package
Maps and Mods are packaged by the `build_release_package.sh` command,
which requires the `parallel` and `smpq` apt packages to run.
If building on Windows, this must be run through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) terminal.

One-time setup:
```sh
sudo apt install parallel
sudo apt install smpq
```

For every build:
```sh
./build_release_package.sh
```

### Fast mod deployment
Only the map files are actually packaged, the mod files are simply copied over.
It may be helpful to create a symlink or create a script to copy files over to deploy mod files quickly.
Note that if the source files are symlinked directly to the target Mods/ directory, then `/download_data`
may overwrite all changes to the source code.

```sh
SC2_MODS_DIR=/path/to/sc2/install/Mods
rm -rf "$SC2_MODS_DIR/Archipelago*.SC2Mod"
cp -r ./Mods/* "$SC2_MODS_DIR"
```
